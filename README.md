## Submission etiquette

>When making a submission to the repository, ensure that you make a submission in only **your** designated branch. Do not defer from it and make a submission to the main branch or make on in another
>members branch. Furthermore, ensure that you always attend the work assigned to you in the roadmap section of the project.

There are a few rules to be followed when making submission to the repository, given the fact that they will be marking us based on how we have managed to log our data while working on the project:

1. Submit only **your** work in **your** branch
2. Don't switch to the main branch for submissions
3. If an issue arises in another members code discuss it in the issues panel by creating a new issue
4. Task assignment is to be done in the project panel
5. Use proper names for each commit
